function f = talbotmod(F,t,N)
%   The function f = talbot(F,t,N) implements Talbot's
%   *modified* method for the inversion of the Laplace 
%   Transform.   F is the transform to be inverted, supplied
%   as an inline function of z.   (The code assumes that F is 
%   real when z is real (*).)   N is the number of F evaluations.   
%   The method is based on a 2N panel midpoint rule approximation, 
%   but because of the symmetry (*) it can be reduced to N evaluations 
%   of F.   The parameters sigma, mu, and nu are tuned for optimality
%   in the case where all the singularities of F are on or near the 
%   negative imaginary axis.   In this case a convergence rate of 
%   about exp(-2.7N) can be expected, i.e.,  N = 14 should usually be 
%   sufficient for full precision in MATLAB.  The code does not yet 
%   make provision for multiple values of t. 
%
%   Example of usage:
%    >> F = inline('1./(z.*sqrt(z+1))')
%    >> f = talbotmod(F,1,10)
